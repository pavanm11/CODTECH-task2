Overview of the Project:

PROJECT:Credit card fraud Detection

OBJECTIVE:
The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. Given the highly imbalanced nature of the dataset, where fraudulent transactions are much fewer compared to legitimate ones, special techniques are needed to handle the imbalance and ensure accurate detection of fraud.

KEY ACTIVITIES:
1.Import Libraries
2.Load the Dataset
3.Data Exploration and Visualization
4.Data Preprocessing
5.Model Building and Training
6.Model Evaluation
7.Handling Class Imbalance
8.Model Performance Improvement
9.Visualization of Results
